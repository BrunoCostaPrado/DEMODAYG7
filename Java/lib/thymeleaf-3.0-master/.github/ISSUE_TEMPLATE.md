<!--
Thanks for raising a Thymeleaf issue.

****
This repository contains the Thymeleaf core. If your issue is specific to
the integration with Spring or you think it could be, please add your ticket
at the "thymeleaf/thymeleaf-spring" repository instead.
****

For ENHANCEMENTS or SUGGESTIONS:

Please describe the problem that you are trying to solve in the maximum
detail possible.

For BUGS:

Please provide the maximum detail possible. We will specifically need:

  * Version of Thymeleaf (and any involved extensions) you are using.
  * Environment: versions of Spring, Spring Boot, or any other 
    relevant libraries.
  * Detailed steps to reproduce your issue.
  * Any possible workarounds you may have found.

Also, providing a test case or sample application reproducing the issue
would largely increase our possibilities to verify, diagnose and fix
the problem.

If you provide a sample application, please write it in Java and make it
as auto-executable as possible (e.g. Spring Boot would be great).
